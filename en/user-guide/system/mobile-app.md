# Remarks

The methods described above are for saving a single module as application and for saving the whole system as application.  Also you can save any view and module as application and after your login you will see what you have saved. Every module can be saved as separate application. 

Saving the index site is saving the whole system. The user will see and open every module (must be installed) where the user have the rights.
