# Remarks

The methods described above are for saving a single module as application and for saving the whole system as an application.  You can also save any view and module as an app. After starting and logging into the app you will see the exact site you have saved. Every module can be saved as a separate app. You can have multiple apps on you Home screen linking to all available VisionR modules and views.

If you save the index as an app you will always see the tile view with all accessible modules on starting the app.
